# Hi Hens

Hi Hens is a site for city and urban dwellers with an interest in keeping hens.

Users of this site will be able to find out more information to help them understand how to keep hens in an urban environment. They will be introduced to the site owners story and practice of hen keeping in a city. There is an introduction, gallery and an outline of courses that the site owner runs. They will also be able to fill in a form to contact the site owner about joining future courses.

The site owners goal is to provide practical introductory information in a warm and friendly way to encourage others to keep hens. Their aim is to drive users to enrol for their courses.

## Features

I am building the pages mobile first

- Navigation

    - The Navigation bar is consistently visible at the top of each page. It features the logo and links to the Home page, Gallery, Courses and Contact pages. It is fully responsive and uses a hamburger drop-down for mobiles.
    - The Navigation bar is always available and makes sure the user can easily find their way to the pages across the site.

- Home Page

    - The Landing page Hero image welcomes the user to the site and illustrates some of the key qualities of the site owners; family friendly, happy hens, bright and sunny.
    - Introductary text welcomes you and explains the site contents.
    - The WHY HENS? section provides answers to the question and encourages the user to consider why hens can be a good idea as family pets in the city.

- The Footer

    - The Footer provides links for the user to the appropriate social media channels that the site owner will set up, encouraging the user to engage further with the site owner.
    - Currently the social media links are for Facebook, Instagram and Youtube, they link to the main pages of the social media groups, not bespoke pages.
    - The social media links always open up in new tabs, and on larger screens for laptops and up, will highlight white as you hover.


- Gallery Page

    - The Gallery Page shows images of the site owners hens and family.
    - The purpose of the page is to share with the user visual information of what keeping hens can look like throughout the year, the set up of the space, the interaction of the family and the joy that this can bring. It serves to be a positive encouragement to the user and also prompt their curiosity to contact the user with a view to joining courses the site owner would like to run.

 - Contact Us

    - The Contact Us page contains a form that the user can submit.
    - The form allows the user to select boxes that determine their interest in a specific course.
    - The form cannot be submitted without the fields filled correctly. The user will be asked to fill in their name and email address. 

## Testing

### Validator testing

- I ran the site through Lighthouse with devtools to check Accessibility of fonts and colors. This highlighted that where I had used a 'ul' element on my index page this wouldn't work very well for screen readers. I changed the elements to divs.
